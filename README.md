# Logscape
## An Open-Source log management tool
[Logscape Commercial Website](http://www.logscape.com) | [Logscape Blog](http://blog.logscape.com) | [Logscape Support](http://support.logscape.com)

Logscape is a big-data analysis tool. Using your logs and other data, Logscape produces clear dashboards and provides real-time alerts. All data is indexed on your system, whether locally, or using a centralised index store. Once indexed you can search the entire stack for a single term, or use precise functions and filters. Logscape is deployed on your infrastructure and provides a straight forward web interface, with enterprise ready access controls.

## Features
* Search log files at scale
* Tail files in real-time
* Analyse each event
* Interactive Search and Discovery
* Automatic JSON and CSV extraction
* [Read them all](http://logscape.com/product.html)

## Installation
If you are just intending to run Logscape then we reccomend using one of our [pre-built releases](www.github.com) and read our [getting started guide](http://logscape.github.io/tutorials-walkthrough.html).
Pre-requisites -
*  JRE 8 or above

Then run Logscape by following these steps.
* Extract the .zip folder
* Configure your [agents role](https://logscape.github.io/deploy.html) (Default: Manager) via the `configure.sh` located in ```/logscape/scripts/```
* Start your agent via `logscape.sh start` or `logscape.bat`
## Using Logscape

Logscape is a monitoring tool for both log file analysis and environment wide instrumentation. Using [Logscape Apps](logscape.github.io/apps.html) it is possible to extract data from almost any system. Each installation ships with the Unix App and Windows App installed, and more can be downloaded from the [App page](logscape.github.io/apps.html) or alternatively you can [create your own](http://logscape.github.io/app-develop.html).
## Deployment
Logscape managers can be used in isolation however Logscape is best leveraged around your entire environment with [Forwarders](http://logscape.github.io/deploy-forwarder.html) shipping logs to [dedicated nodes](http://logscape.github.io/deploy-indexstore.html), the [Logscape support site](http://logscape.github.io/) features a [full deployment guide](http://logscape.github.io/deploy.html).

## Docker
You are welcome to build your own docker containers using Logscape, however we also offer pre-built containers on [dockerhub.](https://hub.docker.com/r/logscape/logscape/)

## Build from Source
If you are looking to modify the code, or would rather build from source than download a pre-compiled executable then follow these steps.
Pre-requisites -
* JDK 8 or above
* [Ant build tool](http://ant.apache.org/)

Then build from source by follow these steps
* Navigate to your checkout directory
* Navigate to the master folder `/LogScape/master`
* Execute `ant clean dist`

On a succesful build this will generate -
* Distributable zip located in `/Logscape/master/dist`
* Expanded build located in `Logscape/master/build`

The artifacts of this build are as follows -
