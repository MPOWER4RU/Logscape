Logscape is a big-data analysis tool which uses your logs to produce clear dashboards and provide real-time alerts. Once your data is indexed you can search the entire environment for a single term, or use precise functions and filters. Logscape is deployed on your infrastructure and provides a straight forward web interface.

## Features
* Search log files at scale
* Tail files in real-time
* Analyse each event
* Interactive Search and Discovery
* Automatic JSON and CSV extraction
* [Read them all](http://logscape.com/product.html)

## Installation
If you are just intending to run Logscape then we reccomend using one of our [pre-built releases](https://github.com/logscape/Logscape/releases/latest) and read our [getting started guide](http://logscape.github.io/tutorials-walkthrough.html).
Pre-requisites -
*  JRE 8 or above

Then run Logscape by following these steps.
* Extract the .zip folder
* Configure your [agents role](https://logscape.github.io/deploy.html) (Default: Manager) via the `configure.sh` located in ```/logscape/scripts/```
* Start your agent via `logscape.sh start` or `logscape.bat`

## Using Logscape
If it's your first time using Logscape, then you can read our [getting started guide](http://logscape.github.io/tutorials-walkthrough.html).
A Logscape deployment consists of atleast one [manager]http://logscape.github.io/deploy-manager.html supported by any number of [indexstores](http://logscape.github.io/deploy-indexstore.html) recieving data from [forwarders](http://logscape.github.io/deploy-forwarder.html).

The management agent will by default include forwarder and indexstore functionality whilst also exposing a web front-end which can be accessed via the `:8080` port.

The sourcing of data within Logscape is controlled by [datasources](http://logscape.github.io/ds.html) which specify file paths, masks and age requirements for Logscape to ingest the data. Once ingested the data will be indexed and become available at search time via the web-front end, for either searching or the creation of [workspaces](http://logscape.github.io/workspaces.html). Users looking to map business logic onto their data can do so by applying [data types](http://logscape.github.io/types.html) onto their datasources, thus enriching the search experience.

Navigation around the application is performed primarily via the left hand menu, with standard functionality such as workspaces, live tailing and searching available to all users. And more technical settings available to team leaders and adminsitrators via the settings interface.

## Deployment
Logscape managers can be used in isolation however Logscape is best leveraged around your entire environment with [Forwarders](http://logscape.github.io/deploy-forwarder.html) shipping logs to [dedicated nodes](http://logscape.github.io/deploy-indexstore.html), the [Logscape support site](http://logscape.github.io/) features a [full deployment guide](http://logscape.github.io/deploy.html).

## Docker
You are welcome to build your own docker containers using Logscape, however we also offer pre-built containers on [dockerhub.](https://hub.docker.com/r/logscape/logscape/)

## Build from Source
If you are looking to modify the code, or would rather build from source than download a pre-compiled executable then follow these steps.
Pre-requisites -
* JDK 8 or above
* [Ant build tool](http://ant.apache.org/)

Then build from source by follow these steps
* Navigate to your checkout directory
* Navigate to the master folder `/LogScape/master`
* Execute `ant clean dist`

On a succesful build this will generate -
* Distributable zip located in `/Logscape/master/dist`
* Expanded build located in `Logscape/master/build`

The artifacts of this build are as follows -
