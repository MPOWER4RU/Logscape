[Logscape.com](http://www.logscape.com) | [Logscape Blog](http://blog.logscape.com) | [Logscape Support](http://support.logscape.com) | [Logscape Apps](www.logscape.github.io/apps)

Logscape provides real-time visibility of log streams, interactive dashboarding, scalable distributed search, file exploration and alerting. Install and run one agent as a Manager (server + web interface) and ship logs by installing agents as Forwarders; alternatively, send network data via Syslog.

## Features
* Search log files at scale
* Ship using agents as LogForwarders
* Ship using Syslog
* Tail data in real-time
* Application/OS metric instrumentation via APPS
* Interactive Search and field discovery (extraction)
* Automatic JSON and CSV extraction
* Centrally manage all shipping rules
* Log Archive support (.snappy-compress or delete)
* [Read them all](http://logscape.com/product.html)

## Installation
Quickstart using a using a [pre-built releases](https://github.com/logscape/Logscape/releases/latest) and read our [getting started guide](http://logscape.github.io/tutorials-walkthrough.html).

Pre-requisites -
*  JRE 8 or above

Run Logscape by following these steps.
* Extract the .zip folder
* Run as Manager (default behaviour) or configure your [agents role](https://logscape.github.io/deploy.html)  via the `configure.sh/bat` located in ```/logscape/scripts/``` to run as a LogFowarder
* Start your agent via `logscape.sh start` or `logscape.bat`

## Using Logscape
View the [getting started guide](http://logscape.github.io/tutorials-walkthrough.html).

View different [deployment configurations](http://logscape.github.io/deploy.html)

## Deployment
Logscape managers can be used in isolation, however, Logscape is best leveraged around your entire environment with [Forwarders](http://logscape.github.io/deploy-forwarder.html) shipping logs to [dedicated nodes](http://logscape.github.io/deploy-indexstore.html), the [Logscape support site](http://logscape.github.io/) features a [full deployment guide](http://logscape.github.io/deploy.html).

## Docker
You are welcome to build your own docker containers using Logscape, however we also offer pre-built containers on [dockerhub.](https://hub.docker.com/r/logscape/logscape/)

## Build from Source
If you are looking to modify the code, or would rather build from the source than download a pre-compiled executable then follow these steps.
```
Note: This repo includes IntelliJ project files for your convenience.
```
Pre-requisites -
* JDK 8 or above
* [Ant build tool](http://ant.apache.org/)

Then build from source by following these steps
* Navigate to your checkout directory
* Navigate to the master folder `/LogScape/master`
* Execute `ant clean dist`

On a successful build, this will generate -
* Distributable zip located in `/Logscape/master/dist`
* Expanded build located in `Logscape/master/build`

The artifacts of this build are as follows -
