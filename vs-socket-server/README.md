#VS-Socket-Server

##Description
The VS-Socket-Server is responsible for running the Logscape socket server which is capable of accepting most forms of data, as well as the writing of this data to file.
When data arrives it is matched against user defined rules found in the `mapping.csv` file, if no match is made then it is viewed as an unknown datasource.

##Configuration
ReGex rules may be defined in the `mapping.csv` file in order for specific dataformats to be named correctly.
